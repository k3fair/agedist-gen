# Emerging Empirical Age Structures in Agent-Based Models **[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

This public repository contains code and data associated with the method we have developed for emerging age structures in agent-based models. The associated preprint is posted at TKTKTK.

This project was developed by [K.R. Fair](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kathyrn-r-fair) and [O.A. Guerrero](http://oguerr.com/), within the Public Policy Programme at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Please direct all correspondence to K.R. Fair (kfair@turing.ac.uk).

You will find all instructions for running simulations [here](TKTK) within the code folder. All data required to run the model is described [here](TKTK) within the data folder.

## System & Hardware Requirements

* macOS Monterey version 12.6 (or similar)

* Sufficient RAM to support storage of data structures during simulations

## Installation Guides

All software should install within a few minutes on a standard computer, the versions listed here are those the scripts have been tested on.

* Python Version 3.9.12 https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Spyder Version 5.3.3 (IDE for python) https://www.spyder-ide.org/

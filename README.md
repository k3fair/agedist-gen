# Emerging Empirical Age Structures in Agent-Based Models **[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

This public repository contains code and data associated with the method we have developed for emerging age structures in agent-based models. The associated preprint is posted at TKTKTK.

This project was developed by [K.R. Fair](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kathyrn-r-fair) and [O.A. Guerrero](http://oguerr.com/), within the Public Policy Programme at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Please direct all correspondence to K.R. Fair (kfair@turing.ac.uk).

You will find all instructions for running simulations [here](TKTK) within the code folder. All data required to run the model is described [here](TKTK) within the data folder.
